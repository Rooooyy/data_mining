**DO NOT DIRECTLY PUSH INTO THE MASTER BRANCH**  
**DO NOT DIRECTLY PUSH INTO THE MASTER BRANCH**  

1. First create your own branch named by yourself, for example `dev/zhuhe`
2. Make changes directly on your own branch
3. After push your dev branch, merge on your local master first(Remember to `pull` before merge), handle conflicts carefully, and then push into the remote master.
4. Plz write commit messages as regularly as possible, refer to [git commit principles](https://blog.csdn.net/github_39506988/article/details/90298780).
